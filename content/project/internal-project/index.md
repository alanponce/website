The COVID-19 Preventive Health Survey is designed to help policymakers and health researchers better monitor and understand peopleâ€™s knowledge, attitudes and practices about COVID-19 to improve communications and their response to the pandemic. This survey is conducted in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), with advice from the World Health Organization.

The survey is designed to provide valuable information to help understand knowledge, attitudes and practices related to preventative behaviors without trading off the privacy of the people who took the survey. Facebook does not share who took the survey with MIT, and they do not share individual survey responses with us. 

With over 2 billion people on Facebook, we are in a unique position to support public health research. We have partnered with trusted academic and nonprofit institutions to build a research network to address some of the world's greatest humanitarian issues. We're currently using our platform to deploy a preventative health survey to support ongoing COVID-19 research and help inform public health decisions and communication.
