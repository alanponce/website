Alan Ponce Alan Ponce is a professor of software development at the University Autonomous of Cd. Juarez (UACJ). His research interests include artifical intelligence, data science, blockchain and internet of thigs.

Since I started my undergraduate modules in Computer Systems Management, I have been exposed to the benefits of combining interdisciplinary fields such as Management, Statistics, and Economics. Later, I gained experience applying this knowledge in public and private sectors in order to generate and use data as one of the main sources for the decision-making process.
